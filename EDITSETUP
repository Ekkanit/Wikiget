The edit (-E) feature requires an account with bot-flag permissions and OAuth owner-only consumer key/secrets

. If you already have a bot account and OAuth owner-only consumer keys/secrets skip to the last step.

. Obtain bot-flag from an administrator. Usually this is done through WP:BRFA 

. Login to https://meta.wikimedia.org with the bot userid

. If the userid is new and doesn't have Confirmed user permissions, apply for it in two places:

       enwiki: Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Confirmed
       meta  : https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Steward_requests/Miscellaneous

. OAuth owner-only consumer registration:

       https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:OAuthConsumerRegistration/propose
        . Check the box "This consumer is for use only by.."
        . IP Ranges and Public RSA Key should be left empty
        . Check the box for edit permissions
       If you ever need to add/change permissions, the old key/secrets are discarded and new ones registered

. Add the provided Keys and Secrets to wikiget. Search wikiget.awk for 'OAuth credentials' shows where to add them.
